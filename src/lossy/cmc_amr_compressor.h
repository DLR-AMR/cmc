 * The main difference between the two approaches is, that in case of a 'One for One' compression, each variable is compressed independetly with the supplied compression criterium.
 * Ergo, each varibale is defined on it's own mesh (One mesh for one variable).
 * In case of a 'One for All' compression, all variables are defined on the same mesh and will be compressed simultaneously, e.g. the compression criterium must be fulfilled for each variable.
 * Therefore, the compresseion of the variables is dependent on one another (One mesh for all variables).
